# integral-chow-ring-monomial
Computation of the integral value of monomials in the Chow group of zero cycles in the moduli space of stable pointed curves of genus zero.

The file titled "integral_value_2022.py" contains the python code for the graphical algorithm for the integration of monomials in the Chow ring of the moduli space of stable marked curves of genus zero. The algorithm is called "the forest algorithm" in the preprint arXiv:2102.03575. To execute the file, one can simply carry out "python integral_value_2022.py" in the terminal window. Detailed explanation/instructions can be found inside the file.
